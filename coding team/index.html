                <p>We are probably living in the worst time our modern society has ever seen in terms of women security. We aim to make women feel as strong as ever and strong enough to fight the parasites of our society, strong enough to fight the odds, strong enough to protect themselves against any sexual assaults. We aim at giving power to those without whom we cease to exist. Our idea is to design a system which shall make every place and every hour safer for women again. A system which shall re-establish how very gregarious mankind is. This system shall geotag and send SOS alert to the nearest police station, close contacts and also alert people in and around the venue of the crime, everything just at a click of a button. The idea is to make up for the time it takes police to arrive at the location.</p>
